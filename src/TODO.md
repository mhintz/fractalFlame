- Update openFrameworks master version
- See if you can use oF master and C++11 (that would be great, you could use a shared_ptr for the field array)
- Change all ofVec3f to ofVec2f
- Implement colors:
		- Implement color palette that can be sampled with a float 0 - 1
		- Each transform function has a float parameter
		- Start with a random float 0 - 1 (the iteration color sampler)
		- When each transform is run, add its float value to the iteration sampler and divide by 2
		- Use the resulting float to get a color out of the color palette
		- Add the resulting color into the buffer at the sample position
		- Increment the alpha value at the sample position
		- At the end, multiply all values in the buffer by log(alpha) / alpha. This averages all the colors in the buffer and scales by the log of alpha
		- Additional scaling may be necessary
